This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

A website to display basic contact information and services. 
The idea is for me (Moralus) to be the face of the 'company' and for the workers (Mom and Co) to 
go out and do the work 

Notes: Spanish contact info will behandled by Blanca Morales & enlish will be handles by Jose Morales.

1/13 TODO: Add background picture to About Us section. Make navbar sticky. Find a font for text. Add hover color to navbar. 

Long Term TODO-Take pictures of Mom for professional presentation.
