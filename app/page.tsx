            <p className="text-[20px]">
              Meet the woman who made it all possible: Blanca Morales.
              After immigrating from Guatemala, Blanca found herself in the land of dreams and
              after working with a cleaning company for two years, decided to take her personal approach
              to the business. Now, Blanca works with her own clients who she has earned the trust of
              and provides her cleaning services to them on a weekly/monthly basis. Blanca would be honored
              to provide you with twelve years of housekeeping service and a personal experience you
              won't find with large-scale cleaning companies. She brings to the table services you could only find
              with her family, where Blanca take pride in the cleanliness of her home.
